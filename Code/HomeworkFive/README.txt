- I added two str methods to the class which are used to easily display the array and list states for the different methods. These are static methods used for cosmetic tasks only.
- I added two swap methods, one for lists and one for arrays so that there can be easily accessible swaps in the code.
- I used two helper methods for merge sort, one for splitting the array, and the other for recombining the parts of the array.
- There is a partition method used for the Quick Sort implementation, this is used for the critical partition task needed in the algorithm.

The answers to the number of step question is in the javadoc comment above every method. The ending analysis is indicated at the end of the file. These notes are constructed such that they are easily readable with VSCodes better comment extension, so the question number starts with an !, and the step responses start with ?. I use the <p> symbol to allow better readability in the documentation.
